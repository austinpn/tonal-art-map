I updated Oskar's implementation of Tonal Art Maps, based on [[http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/hatching/hatching.pdf][this paper]]. I ported it to URP and rewrote the rendering and tone value checks to use shaders.

The biggest thing missing comared to the source paper is they used 6 tone blending. I did not have time to implement that part of Emil Praun, et al.'s research. I compensated by generating a large number of tone values, though that still does not have quite the desired pencil blending effect.

The project includes both a generator that generates the tonal art map
as well as a shader that can render it. The generator can be accessed as an editor window in unity. (Generators>Tonal Art Map Generator)

The generated art maps are not included.
